# AutoDrivingCarUsingNeuronNetwork
Hi everyone,
This is my very first completed project that I've done and uploaded in Github. This project is about using Neuron Network programming model
and Genetic Algorithm to guide that car moving around the track. The Car will learn and improve it self everytime it crashes. I study source
code from this project https://github.com/matthewrdev/Neural-Network written in C++ and I convert it into Java. The Graphics is completely
different though. 
I pubish my document, report, UML ... which are everything I've done for my capstone project at Marshall University. I hope you guys will
find it useful. 
Thank you
